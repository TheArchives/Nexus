This license is subject to change without warning or consent. In the event that it does, the old version becomes void in favour of the new one, and any and all releases must follow this license. This means that everyone must abide by the new license, even if the copy they downloaded was under an older version of it.

No terms apply to this section of attribution, however if any sort of source code is modified, the next section of attribution must be followed as well.

2. Modification
If one uses the source code of iCraft in modification, specific terms must comply. These include, and are not limited to:

a. The original content must stay in the "/credits" command, and only addition to the context and source of this command is allowed to preserve credits where they apply.
b. The command "/about" must stay mentioned in the "/help" command, as well as "/credits" being mentioned in "/help" and "/about" too.
c. All persons of the VIP in-gaming rank (yellow name) must stay intact. Although users may be added to this list, the users that were originally on it may not.
d. You can not remove the notification of the 'spotted' messages for joining OR the message of being a 'developer' in the "/who playername" command

The forked software, if released for public download, must be forked from the iCraft BitBucket.
